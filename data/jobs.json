Working at the World Bank Group provides a unique opportunity for you to help our clients solve their greatest development challenges. The World Bank Group is one of the largest sources of funding and knowledge for developing countries; a unique global partnership of five institutions dedicated to ending extreme poverty, increasing shared prosperity and promoting sustainable development. With 189 member countries and more than 120 offices worldwide, we work with public and private sector partners, investing in groundbreaking projects and using data, research, and technology to develop solutions to the most urgent global challenges. For more information, visit www.worldbank.org.\n    \n    Sustainable environment and natural resources management (ENRM) is at the heart of the WBG's poverty agenda. Biodiversity and natural resources constitute the social safety net of the poor, representing a food bank and often their only source of livelihood. Sustainable ENRM promotes a green, clean, and resilient world where natural resources  from forests to fisheries, freshwater, oceans, coastal zones and ecosystems  are managed to support livelihoods and strong economies. Sustainable ENRM builds a world better prepared for shocks and global challenges, helping countries limit their exposure to resource scarcity, more-volatile weather patterns, and the long-term consequences of climate change.\n    \n    The Environment & Natural Resources (ENR) Global Practice has been set-up to deliver on the opportunities, benefits and outcomes offered by enhanced management of the environment and natural resources. The ENR GP has close to 300 operations under management, representing close to $7 billion, and a growing pipeline of new investments under active development. The practice consists of some 300 staff across the world plus numerous other staff in other Practices and Cross Cutting SAs that are professionally associated with it. ENR GP also manages the environmental risk aspects of about 2000 projects in the World Banks global portfolio. About 150 staff work specifically on environmental risk management / safeguards.\n    \n    Note: safeguards has been the global term for the World Banks environmental and social risk assessment and management support for the operations it finances. On October 1st, 2018 the World Bank switched from the safeguards policies to the new Environmental and Social Framework  ESF, and its 10 environmental and social standards (ESS) that govern ES compliance and sustainability in the Banks portfolio of investment project financing (IPF). Under the ESF safeguards are now defined as Environmental and Social Risk Management, ESRM. The safeguards policies still apply to projects that had conceptual designs approved before October 1st, 2018. In this job description, ES risk management and safeguards are used as synonyms, unless explicitly differentiated.\n    \n    The Environment & Natural Resources Global Practice has three broad and distinct functions:\n    \n    1.Provides clients with lending and non-lending services aimed to support the GPs three core business lines, namely: (i) Forests, Watersheds and Sustainable Landscapes; (ii) Marine, Coastal and Aquatic Resources; and (iii) Pollution Management and Environmental Health. The GPs activities also include a focus on Clean and Resilient Growth through its work on environmental economics and support to institutional development.\n    2.Supports effective environmental risk management and sustainability by managing risk at the project level and creating opportunities to advance sustainable development, in part through the implementation of the Banks environmental policies.\n    3.Works closely with other sectors, including by leveraging GEF grant financing, to mainstream environmental considerations into their policies, strategies, and operations.\n    \n    ENRM activities in East Asia and the Pacific accounts for a substantial part of the ENR Global Practices business:\n     delivery of about 10 operations per year, amounting to about $500 million annually\n     an active dialogue on regional issues, such as climate change, coastal and marine economies, improving governance of natural resources, watershed management, pollution management, and wealth accounting and valuation of ecosystem services\n     about 61 active projects in the portfolio, amounting to around $1.8 billion\n     a key characteristic of the Bank program in the region is a high level of decentralization. In 2016, 70% of staff was located in the country level offices, and about 60% of operations are managed and led from the country level offices.\n    \n    Almost all environmental risk management / safeguards staff are based in country level offices outside of the Washington, D.C. headquarters. The underpinning of this decentralization rests on four main pillars:\n    \n     better integration at the field level to provide greater synergies and integrated responses\n     decentralized management structure supported by regional and global knowledge\n     provision of faster responses and management decisions to our clients\n     the need to reposition ourselves in the region given the large urbanization and decentralization trend in almost all countries, the need to incorporate better environment dimensions of the fast growth rates and huge demand for infrastructure, and the need to better deal with governance issues and growing income disparities between urban centers and rural areas and lagging regions.\n    \n    Regional Context\n    \n    The East Asia and Pacific (EAP) Region presents a dramatic illustration of the global dynamics, opportunities and risks of the 21st century. After making the fastest progress in growth and poverty reduction of any region around the world in the last fifteen years, some countries in the region  such as Mongolia  are poised to become middle-income, and some are preparing to join the small group of high-income countries. Such a rapid transformation is leading to the largest shift in rural-to-urban population in human history, generating rising inequality within and across countries, leaving individuals and regions behind in the dash for prosperity. Meanwhile, the uncertainty in the advanced economies clouds the prospects for countries across the region which are being forced to adjust to changed growth and development prospects while addressing evolving impacts on macroeconomic stability, employment and poverty.\n    \n    EAP comprises of more than 20 countries, including China, several MICs, LICs, and fragile states (EAP has the second highest number of fragile states amongst all the Bank regions  6 of 7 are in the Pacific). The Region is characterized by generally rapid growth, both sophisticated and low capacity borrowers, and some highly dynamic sectors. At the same time, EAP countries are faced with weak governance environments. The Bank's program in EAP is multi-faceted and has grown rapidly in recent years: annual new lending in FY15 exceeded $6.0 billion; the existing portfolio consists of about 250 operations with a value of about $12 billion; and the TF program is significant (with a portfolio of about $1.2 billion). EAP consists of over 1000 staff with 25% in Washington and 75% based in the country offices in the six Country Management Units.\n    \n    Unit and Country Context\n    \n    The World Bank member countries of the Pacific Region (Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Palau, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu); and Papua New Guinea are important clients for the World Bank. Five of these countries are considered fragile states. The World Banks existing portfolio in the Pacific is about 78 projects with a value of US$1.7 billion. New lending is about 15 projects with a value of US$360 million per year. Lending is expected to double in the next 3 years. The portfolio is heavily focused on infrastructure development, particularly airports, roads, ports, hydropower, solar power, coastal reinforcement; human resource development, particularly health and education; and natural resource management in such areas as fishery and forestry management. The entire portfolio is focused on the adaptation and risk reduction related to climate change and natural disasters, which are a very serious development challenge for this region. The Environment and Natural Resources Global Practice provides environmental safeguards and environmental risk management support to the broader World Bank portfolio in the Pacific and Papua New Guinea.\n    \n    The Environment and Natural Resource Management Global Practice Unit for East Asia and Pacific, for China, Indonesia and Pacific is managed by a Manager based in Singapore. This manager is supported by senior staff who provide day to day technical leadership in their areas of specialization and are responsible for providing technical and quality support for outputs across the region, leading the region-wide communities of practice, connecting staff to international knowledge, leading cutting-edge sector policy and lending work in the region, and mentoring staff mapped to that particular sector on the latest developments in that practice. In the case of environmental risk management / safeguards the manager is supported by a Regional Safeguards Coordinator (RSC), currently based in Bangkok, and a Pacific Regional Safeguards Focal Point based in Sydney, who are responsible for day to day management of safeguards activities. Most staff in the Environment and Natural Resources Practice are expected to provide at least part-time safeguards support in their area of technical expertise. About one third of the Environment and Natural Resources Practice staff in East Asia work exclusively on safeguards and environmental risk management. The regional management attaches particular importance to creating a supportive work environment based on the values of teamwork, transparency, trust and client services, accompanied by professional excellence.\n    \n    Duties and Accountabilities\n    \n    The ETC Environmental Engineer will be based in Sydney, Australia and s/he will report to the EAP Environment, Natural Resources and Blue Economy (ENB) Practice Manager in Singapore. For day to day coordination the Environmental Specialist would work under the direction of the Sydney-based Safeguards Focal Point.
