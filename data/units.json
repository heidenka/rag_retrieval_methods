Most organisations usually deploy several relational databases for operational convenience. It is quite often necessary to integrate the information existing in different relational databases for planning and decision making. Data warehouses are built to facilitate planning and decision making in businesses integrating data from different relational databases. Online analytical processing (OLAP) is a technology that uses a data warehouse for answering aggregation queries often used in planning. While relational databases hold important transactional information of a business, the success of a business quite often depends on advanced planning and development of strategies based on customer behaviour. Data mining technologies are used for discovering such patterns and trends in data stored in relational databases. This unit introduces the key mechanisms in data warehousing and OLAP. It discusses logical and physical design of data warehouses including star schema, snowflake schema, data marts, partitioning and materialised views.
